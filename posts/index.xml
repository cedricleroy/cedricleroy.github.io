      <description>From my first programming steps, I used a bunch of different IDEs to code, depending on the times and the programming language used: Borland C++, Code::Blocks (for C), Visual Studio (C, C++), Matlab IDE, IDLE (Python native IDE), Eclipse (With PyDev for Python), Spyder, Sublime Text, Vim, VS Code, etc.
This is somehow chronological. I lately used VS Code because of three main reasons: This is a great software from Microsoft, I needed to work on Windows (unfortunately) and wanted something great for switching between languages.</description>

      <description>This website uses hugo, a static website generator. There is no particular reasons for me choosing hugo. There are tons of other solutions available. I needed something simple enough to avoid the hassle of learning a new framework, being static and support of markdown. Google leaded me to hugo.
Installation (MacOS)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; brew install hugo  Creating a new site hugo new mynewsite  Themes Hugo uses themes. I picked up after dark, a minimalist dark theme.</description>
